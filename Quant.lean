We have covered the basics of propositional logic. The main limitation 
of propositional logic is that all statements have to be propositions. 
For example, we are not allowed to talk about a statement like: `n` is odd. 
This is not a proposition because `n` does not actually have a value. It 
is a placeholder which will be instantiated at some point by an actual 
value. 
Propositions that depend on variables are called _predicates_. They are 
implemented in Lean quite easily.

variable {α β : Type} 
variable (P P': α → Prop) (Q : α → β → Prop) 

/- 
Here `P` is a predicate on one variable by type `α` while `Q` is a 
predicate on two variables. 
-/

def leSquare : ℕ → ℕ → Prop := fun n m ↦ n ≤ m^2 

/-
We can convert predicates into propositions by _quantifying_ over them. 
In our previous example, we can go from `n` is odd to for all `n`, `n` is 
odd. This is now a proposition. 
Instead of asking that the predicate is true for all values, we can ask 
that it is true for at least one value: there exists `n` such that `n` is 
odd.

def allLESquare : Prop := ∀ n m, leSquare n m

def someLESquare : Prop := ∃ n m, leSquare n m 

/- 
Since we have multiple variables, we use different quantifiers. 
-/

def allLESomeSquare : Prop := ∀ n, ∃ m, leSquare n m 

def someLEAllSquares : Prop := ∃ n, ∀ m, leSquare n m 

/-
Notice that the order of quantifiers is important in general. 
-/

def someSquareGEAll : Prop := ∃ m, ∀ n, leSquare n m 

/-
Like the connectives, quantified statements have introduction and elimination 
rules.
The universal quantifier is essentially a function that take as input 
any value of the variables and gives as output a proof the proposition 
with that value. In Lean it acts as such.

example : ∀ (n : ℕ), n = n  := by
  intro n
  rfl 

example : ∀ (n : ℕ), n = n  := fun _ => rfl

example (h : allLESquare) : 5 ≤ 4 := by 
  exact h 5 2

/-
The existentional quantifier in contrast is implemented as its own inductive 
type. 
/--
Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h`.

  then `⟨a, h⟩` is a proof that `∃ x : α, p x`. -/

We can commute quantifiers of the same type.
